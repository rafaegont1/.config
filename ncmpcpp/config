##### song format #####

## For a song format you can use:

## %l - length
## %f - filename
## %D - directory
## %a - artist
## %A - album artist
## %t - title
## %b - album
## %y - date
## %n - track number (01/12 -> 01)
## %N - full track info (01/12 -> 01/12)
## %g - genre
## %c - composer
## %p - performer
## %d - disc
## %C - comment
## %P - priority
## $R - begin right alignment

## If you want to make sure that a part of the format is displayed only when
## certain tags are present, you can archieve it by grouping them with brackets,
## e.g. '{%a - %t}' will be evaluated to 'ARTIST - TITLE' if both tags are
## present or '' otherwise.  It is also possible to define a list of
## alternatives by providing several groups and separating them with '|',
## e.g. '{%t}|{%f}' will be evaluated to 'TITLE' or 'FILENAME' if the former is
## not present.

## Note: If you want to set limit on maximal length of a tag, just put the
## appropriate number between % and character that defines tag type, e.g. to
## make album take max. 20 terminal cells, use '%20b'.

## In addition, formats support markers used for text attributes.  They are
## followed by character '$'. After that you can put:

## - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
## - 1 - black
## - 2 - red
## - 3 - green
## - 4 - yellow
## - 5 - blue
## - 6 - magenta
## - 7 - cyan
## - 8 - white
## - 9 - end of current color
## - b - bold text
## - u - underline text
## - i - italic text
## - r - reverse colors
## - a - use alternative character set

## If you don't want to use a non-color attribute anymore, just put it again,
## but this time insert character '/' between '$' and attribute character,
## e.g. {$b%t$/b}|{$r%f$/r} will display bolded title tag or filename with
## reversed colors.

## If you want to use 256 colors and/or background colors in formats (the naming
## scheme is described below in section about color definitions), it can be done
## with the syntax $(COLOR), e.g. to set the artist tag to one of the
## non-standard colors and make it have yellow background, you need to write
## $(197_yellow)%a$(end). Note that for standard colors this is interchangable
## with attributes listed above.

## Note: colors can be nested.

song_list_format = {$4%a - }{%t}|{$8%f$9}$R{$3(%l)$9}

song_status_format = $b{{$8"%t"}} $3by {$4%a{ $3in $7%b{ (%y)}} $3}|{$8%f}

song_library_format = {%n - }{%t}|{%f}

alternative_header_first_line_format = $b$1$aqqu$/a$9 {%t}|{%f} $1$atqq$/a$9$/b

alternative_header_second_line_format = {{$4$b%a$/b$9}{ - $7%b$9}{ ($4%y$9)}}|{%D}

current_item_prefix = $(cyan)$r$b

current_item_suffix = $/r$(end)$/b

current_item_inactive_column_prefix = $(magenta)$r

current_item_inactive_column_suffix = $/r$(end)

##### various settings #####

## Note: Custom command that will be executed each time song changes. Useful for
## notifications etc.

#execute_on_song_change="pkill -RTMIN+11 dwmblocks"

##
## Note: Custom command that will be executed each time player state
## changes. The environment variable MPD_PLAYER_STATE is set to the current
## state (either unknown, play, pause, or stop) for its duration.

# Note: Possible display modes: classic, columns.playlist_display_mode = columns

browser_display_mode = columns

## Note: You can specify third character which will be used to build 'empty'
## part of progressbar.

progressbar_look = ->

## Available values: artist, album_artist, date, genre, composer, performer.

media_library_primary_tag = artist

media_library_albums_split_by_date = no

## Screens available for use: help, playlist, browser, search_engine,
## media_library, playlist_editor, tag_editor, outputs, visualizer, clock,
## lyrics, last_fm.

screen_switcher_mode = playlist, media_library

## Note: You can define startup screen by choosing screen from the list above.

startup_screen = "playlist"

display_volume_level = no

## Note: if below is enabled, ncmpcpp will ignore leading "The" word while
## sorting items in browser, tags in media library, etc.

ignore_leading_the = yes

external_editor = vim

use_console_editor = yes

##### colors definitions #####
##
## It is possible to set a background color by setting a color value
## "<foreground>_<background>", e.g. red_black will set foregound color to red
## and background color to black.
##
## In addition, for terminals that support 256 colors it is possible to set one
## of them by using a number in range [1, 256] instead of color name,
## e.g. numerical value corresponding to red_black is 2_1. To find out if the
## terminal supports 256 colors, run ncmpcpp and check out the bottom of the
## help screen for list of available colors and their numerical values.
##
## What is more, there are two special values for the background color:
## "transparent" and "current". The first one explicitly sets the background to
## be transparent, while the second one allows you to preserve current
## background color and change only the foreground one. It's used implicitly
## when background color is not specified.
##
## Moreover, it is possible to attach format information to selected color
## variables by appending to their end a colon followed by one or more format
## flags, e.g. black:b or red:ur. The following variables support this syntax:
## visualizer_color, color1, color2, empty_tag_color, volume_color,
## state_line_color, state_flags_color, progressbar_color,
## progressbar_elapsed_color, player_state_color, statusbar_time_color,
## alternative_ui_separator_color.
##
## Note: due to technical limitations of older ncurses version, if 256 colors
## are used there is a possibility that you'll be able to use only colors with
## transparent background.

colors_enabled = yes

empty_tag_color = magenta

main_window_color = white

progressbar_color = black:b

progressbar_elapsed_color = blue:b

statusbar_color = red

statusbar_time_color = cyan:b
